# sap_vm_temp_vip Ansible Role
<!-- END Title -->

## Description
<!-- BEGIN Description -->
Ansible role `sap_vm_temp_vip` is used to enable installation of SAP Application and Database on High Availability clusters provisioned by [sap_vm_provision](https://github.com/sap-linuxlab/community.sap_infrastructure/tree/main/roles/sap_vm_provision) role.

Installation of cluster environment requires temporary assignment of Virtual IP (VIP) before executing installation roles [sap_hana_install](https://github.com/sap-linuxlab/community.sap_install/tree/main/roles/sap_hana_install) and [sap_swpm](https://github.com/sap-linuxlab/community.sap_install/tree/main/roles/sap_swpm).
- This is temporary and it will be replaced by Cluster VIP resource once cluster is configured by [sap_ha_pacemaker_cluster](https://github.com/sap-linuxlab/community.sap_install/tree/main/roles/sap_ha_pacemaker_cluster) role.

This role does not update `/etc/hosts` or DNS, because that is completed by [sap_vm_provision](https://github.com/sap-linuxlab/community.sap_infrastructure/tree/main/roles/sap_vm_provision) role.
<!-- END Description -->

## Prerequisites
<!-- BEGIN Prerequisites -->
Environment:
1. Execute role with `gather_facts: true`, as it uses `ansible_default_ipv4` facts.
2. Assign hosts to correct groups, which are also used in other roles in our project
    - Supported cluster groups: `hana_primary, hana_secondary, anydb_primary, anydb_secondary, nwas_ascs, nwas_ers`

Dependent on roles:
1. [sap_vm_provision](https://github.com/sap-linuxlab/community.sap_infrastructure/tree/main/roles/sap_vm_provision) to create required resources: DNS, Load Balancers and Health Checks.
<!-- END Prerequisites -->

## Execution
<!-- BEGIN Execution -->
Role can be execute separately or as part of [ansible.playbooks_for_sap](https://github.com/sap-linuxlab/ansible.playbooks_for_sap) playbooks.
<!-- END Execution -->

### Execution Flow
<!-- BEGIN Execution Flow -->
1. Assert that required inputs were provided.
2. Collect missing inputs using provided inputs (example: Calculate prefix from netmask, if VIP prefix was not defined)
3. Append VIP to network interface
    - SAP HANA Primary host if both groups are present: `hana_primary, hana_secondary`
    - SAP AnyDB Primary host if both groups are present: `anydb_primary, anydb_secondary`
    - SAP ASCS host if both groups are present: `nwas_ascs, nwas_ers`
    - SAP ERS host if both groups are present:` nwas_ascs, nwas_ers`
4. Install `netcat` and start 12 hour process to ensure that Load Balancer Health Checks are working before Cluster is configured.
    - Limited to platforms with Network Load Balancers and `IPAddr2` resource agent: Google Cloud, MS Azure, IBM Cloud.
<!-- END Execution Flow -->

### Example
